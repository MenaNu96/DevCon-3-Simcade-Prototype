Hi and welcome to Easy Rope Bridge!

Firstly a big THANK YOU for supporting my assets! 
You can find my other assets at: https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/31828?aid=1100le847

Making bridges just got a whole lot easier. The original version made things easy but the new version improves on that.

-------------
CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
- primitive or stylized look.
- varying plank styles.
- varying size plank width.
- varying size gap between planks.
- rigid or physics-based.
- optional end posts and hand rails.

------------
INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1. Press Alt-B (or select 'GameObject > 3D Object > Create Easy Rope Bridge' from the Unity menu).
2. Set any additional options in the Inspector (e.g. Plank Number).
3. Click Play in the editor.
4. Once the bridge has been created by the script and BEFORE clicking Play to stop the project running, drag the game object you created from the Hierarchy pane into your Project pane to create a prefab.
You now have your own personalized bridge! By default, the bridge game object will be renamed depending on the options you selected until you stop Playing, at which point it will revert back to the default name.

* Remember to delete the game object that you created in step 1, otherwise it will try to generate another new bridge when you press Play.

NOTES
-----
- Each plank has it's own rigidbody and collider, so your characters can walk on it realistically. We are unable to provide physics support, due to the multiple different circumstances that this asset could be used under.
- The script is fully documented, so you can modify it to your needs.  If you change the script and something stops working, you can always import it again to return to the original code.
- No textures were included in this asset, however at textures.com you can search for free 'wood' and 'rope' textures.  
  Save or drag them into your project assets folder, then drag them from the Project pane onto the individual game objects.
